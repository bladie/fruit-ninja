# Fruit-Ninja
This project is a recreation of the popular Fruit Ninja game, implemented using Python's Pygame and Tkinter libraries. The game provides an engaging and interactive experience where players slice fruits flying across the screen while avoiding bombs. The inclusion of a custom logo adds a personalized touch to the game.
